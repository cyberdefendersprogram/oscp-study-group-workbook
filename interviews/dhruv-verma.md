* [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/122UBRhgM443_WZZ4TERQnpzyEQaOTLZtPHbFT968LFI/edit?usp=sharing/)
* Buffer Overflow [Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Software/Buffer_Overflow)

Btw, here are some key takeaways students thought they took from your presentation:

* One line I really took from the talk is organizing and sectioning off time for OSCP. To me, that meant that it's not about the short run, where I would try to blast through all the machines in one go, but to pick a time and workflow that works for me.
* My biggest takeaways were the differences from how I as a learner approach hacking vs someone who does it professionally. I would probably end up doing many of the same things, but in a much more manual way which wouldn't scale to testing a whole network.
